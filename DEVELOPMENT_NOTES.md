# Professional College System - Development Notes

## Overview
This is a Laravel-based content management system for a professional college in Georgia. The system supports multilingual content (Georgian and English) and provides comprehensive management tools for educational content, staff profiles, programs, and administrative functions.

## System Architecture

### Multilingual Support
- **JSON-based storage**: All multilingual content is stored as JSON in database fields
- **Custom casting**: Uses `JsonConvertCast` for seamless array access to translations
- **Language routing**: All routes prefixed with language parameter (`/{language}/...`)
- **Supported languages**: Georgian (`ka`) and English (`en`)

### Key Features
1. **Article Management**: News articles and blog posts with rich media support
2. **Staff Profiles**: Teacher and staff member profile management
3. **Program Catalog**: Educational program and course information
4. **Document Library**: File uploads and document management
5. **Gallery System**: Photo and video gallery management
6. **Contact System**: Contact form handling and visitor tracking

## Database Design

### Multilingual Fields Pattern
```php
// Example: Article model
'title' => ['ka' => 'Georgian Title', 'en' => 'English Title']
'description' => ['ka' => 'Georgian Description', 'en' => 'English Description']
```

### Key Tables
- `articles`: News and blog posts with categories and embedded content
- `teachers`: Teaching staff profiles with subjects and photos
- `staff`: Administrative staff information
- `categories`: Content categorization system
- `programs`: Educational programs and courses
- `docs`: Document attachments and files

## Image Management

### Upload Strategy
- **Unique naming**: `uniqid() . '-' . time() . '.' . extension`
- **Directory structure**:
  - Articles: `public/images/articles/`
  - Teachers: `public/images/teachers/`
  - Staff: `public/images/staff/`
- **Formats supported**: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- **Size limits**: Configurable via validation rules

### TODO: Image Optimization
- [ ] Implement automatic image resizing
- [ ] Add thumbnail generation
- [ ] Consider cloud storage integration (AWS S3, etc.)
- [ ] Add image compression for web optimization

## Security Implementation

### Authentication
- Admin-only access to CRUD operations
- Custom `RouteGuard` middleware for admin protection
- Session-based authentication system

### File Upload Security
- Validation of file types and sizes
- Unique filename generation to prevent conflicts
- Storage outside of public access for sensitive documents

### TODO: Security Enhancements
- [ ] Implement role-based permissions
- [ ] Add CSRF protection verification
- [ ] Sanitize embedded content (iframe/script tags)
- [ ] Add rate limiting for contact forms
- [ ] Implement audit logging for admin actions

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- **Eager loading**: Use `with()` to prevent N+1 queries
- **Pagination**: Implement on all listing pages
- **Indexing**: Add indexes on frequently queried fields

### Caching Strategy (TODO)
- [ ] Implement Redis/Memcached for session storage
- [ ] Add route caching for production
- [ ] Cache multilingual content for faster access
- [ ] Implement view caching for public pages

## Development Workflow

### Code Standards
- **PSR-4 autoloading**: Follow Laravel naming conventions
- **DocBlock comments**: Comprehensive documentation for all methods
- **Type hints**: Use return type declarations and parameter types
- **Validation**: Use Form Request classes for complex validation

### Testing Strategy (TODO)
- [ ] Implement unit tests for models and business logic
- [ ] Add feature tests for critical user journeys
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- [ ] Add browser testing for multilingual functionality

## Deployment Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Application
APP_NAME="Professional College"
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://your-domain.com

# Database
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=prof_college
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password

# Mail Configuration
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=your-smtp-host
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
```

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Enable route caching: `php artisan route:cache`
- [ ] Enable config caching: `php artisan config:cache`
- [ ] Enable view caching: `php artisan view:cache`
- [ ] Set proper file permissions (storage, bootstrap/cache)
- [ ] Configure SSL certificate
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Configure log rotation
- [ ] Implement monitoring and error tracking

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Critical Issues
1. **UUID regeneration on update**: Article updates regenerate UUID, breaking existing links
2. **Image cleanup**: Old images not deleted when replaced, causing storage bloat
3. **Controller naming**: `slideController` should be `SlideController` for PSR-4 compliance
4. **Success messages**: Inconsistent messaging (some say "added" when updating)

### Improvement Opportunities
1. **Soft deletes**: Implement for data recovery capabilities
2. **Form requests**: Create dedicated request classes for better validation
3. **API endpoints**: Consider adding API for mobile app integration
4. **Search functionality**: Implement full-text search for articles and content
5. **SEO optimization**: Add meta tags, sitemaps, and structured data

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term (Next Sprint)
- [ ] Fix UUID regeneration issue in ArticleController
- [ ] Implement proper image cleanup on deletion/replacement
- [ ] Add search functionality to admin panels
- [ ] Create missing Blade templates for TeacherController

### Medium-term (Next Quarter)
- [ ] Implement role-based access control
- [ ] Add API endpoints for mobile application
- [ ] Implement advanced image processing (thumbnails, optimization)
- [ ] Add email notifications for content updates

### Long-term (Next Year)
- [ ] Student information system integration
- [ ] Online course management
- [ ] Payment processing for courses
- [ ] Advanced analytics and reporting
- [ ] Multi-campus support

## Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor storage usage (images accumulating without cleanup)
- Review and update dependencies monthly
- Backup database weekly
- Review error logs daily in production

### Periodic Reviews
- Security audit quarterly
- Performance review semi-annually
- Code quality assessment annually
- User feedback collection ongoing
